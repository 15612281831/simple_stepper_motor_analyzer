3D Models for printing. 


Base is an open frame design that uses a standard 0.1" headers to connect
the display and the Analyzer boards.


Case is a closed design that is more appealing but also more difficult
to build. It uses a type B (reversed) 40 wires 0.1" flex cable to connect
the two boards and M2.5 heat inserts to attache the front and the back 
of the case.


Both designs use the same PCB design and use 16 bit parallel data path to the 
display, but with different 40 wires connectors.
